Download either file
.zip file, just open/extract the folder and drop it into your project's Assets Folder.
.unitypackage file, have your project open then open the file. It should automatically import to the project.
A README.md is inside of the documentation folder that should be clear and straight forward to follow.
Let me know if there are any problems.
